# XPath Python
This is a project to pull data from the XML samples using XPath in Python code.

## TODO
    - why are the fields prefixed with {urn:hl7-org:v3} ?
    - observation(s)
    - provider
    - care_iste
    - proper database for the IDs?
    - objects instead of dictionaries for the OMOP entities?
    - mapping
    - better understanding of HL7  vocabularies and OIDs
    - how to use this code as documentation of the mapping, how to verify it, how to validate it
